Reflection on statistics.
We have seen 4 measurements of central tendency (the *average*): mean, median, mode and midpoint.

Do you think one of them is a better measure of central tendency (finding an *average*) than the others?  There are several resources to help you answer this question that can be accessed with a google search on the Internet.

Your assignment is to 
1. Find an article appropriate to your level of understanding that helps you decide if one method is better than the others
2. Think about and describe situations where one measure would be more appropriate/useful than another.
3. Write a paragraph here that discusses your answer.


In my opinion, the Mean is the best way to measure central tendency; the Mean will often be the most accurate to any given data set. The Mean is, however, prone to being skewed by outliers to the data, especially within smaller data sets. The Median seems to be the most effective of these in smaller data sets, with a far smaller influence by outliers than the Mean has, as well as being able to be calculated with unknown values in the data (so long as they are put in the proper order.) the Mode has no guarantee to actually find the middle of a data set unless the set is mostly symmetrical, but will be closer to the Mean and Median as the sample size increases. The Midpoint is likely to give a similar answer to the Mean, but is also prone to being swayed by outliers, even moreso than the Mean, due to only taking into account 2 numbers.
